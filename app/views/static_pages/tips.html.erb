        <ul>
            <li class="check"> Everybody uses LinkedIn.  Everybody.  It can be very hard to stand out.  Not all jobs are 
                advertised on LinkedIn. Use a <a href="/boolean">Boolean search</a> instead.  Copy and paste this into a google search window:
                (site:jobs.lever.co OR site:boards.greenhouse.io OR site:myworkdayjobs.com) AND ("Software" OR "Full Stack" OR "Fullstack" OR "Full-stack" OR "Web") AND ("Developer" OR "Engineer") AND ("California" OR "Sacramento" OR "remote")
                </li>
            <li class="check"> Always follow up by messaging the recruiter immediately.  Less than 1% of all applicants do
                 this. This helps you stick out.  It is okay to use some AI responses here.</li>
            <li class="check"> There are no more cover letters used!  Instead, when you can, use AI to craft something unique 
                to the job posting and your resume.  Pathrise has a wonderful feature for this.</li>
            <li class="check"> Resume Writer: Only have one written by a professional who 
                <em>specializes in Software Engineering </em>resumes.  Read multiple reviews!</li>
            <li class="check"> Health Benefits?  Some jobs don't offer them.  ObamaCare might cover some of the cost.  
                However, those plans are terrible!  Either stick with larger companies or negotiate a higher
                salary with smaller companies to compensate for the high cost of premiums, deductables, and copays!</li>
            <li class="check"> What is the Pay Range?  In the State of California, the 
                <a href="https://californiapayroll.com/blog/sb-1162-california-pay-transparency-law/">Pay Transparency Law</a> 
                all <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/2022/12/california-pay-transparency-law/">employers are required by law</a>
                to fully disclose the pay range.  In 2023, some employers were offering a pay range of... $25 to $35 an hour!
                Others in the $100k to $130k, and still others $150k to $215k...</li>
            <li class="check"> Employee Reviews.  Check out their standing on <a href="glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a> 
                and other sites!  Don't be stuck in a terrible corporate environment.</li>
            <li class="check"> Skills Growth. What new skills will you be learning?  And, where are those skills located on the 
                <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a>?  Is there a future for those skills?  </li>
            <li class="check"> Work-Life Balance.  Do they allow to work from home?  Flexible Hours?  
                Can longer breaks be taken to run errands, doctor's visits, walks, and bike rides?</li>
            <li class="check"> Read their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement.  Be extra wary of businesses
                located in unfriendly states!</li>
            <li class="check"> Does the company allow for gig work on the side (to offset lower pay?)?</li>
            <li class="check"> Social Networking.  Companies review your posts and network.  Is there anybody on Facebook 
                or LinkedIn you'd rather them not see?</li>
            <li class="check"> Its always best to look for work when you alrady have a job.  It may be a slower search, but
                you're able to say no to lower pay.  Plus, the stress level of having no income while searching is PAINFUL!
            </li>
            <li class="check"> Do they look at extra projects that you've worked on? Participate in open source projects.  
                Create your own project website and share the url and open up the repository on GitHub.</li>
