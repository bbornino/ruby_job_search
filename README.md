# Job Search Tracker

## About the Author
This project has been written by Bornino.  It is intended to be more of a demonstration of my abilities to easily learn new languages and MVCs.  I am the sole author however I will gladly entertain feedback and useful enhancements.

## About the Project
This project maintains a list of job search sites (linkedin, dice, indeed, etc. ) that I check often for job listings. Each site has metadata that the user controls to track differences between the sites. On a site basis, it tracks which job listings I have applied to, along with the status for each job listing, and other listing metadata. Separate reports are also available for gathering statistical information about the job hunt.  More information is located on my web site [Ruby App](https://bornino.net/projects/ruby-app/) page.
